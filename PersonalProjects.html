    <h1>Personal Projects</h1>
    <p>I've done many personal projects over the years. There are some simplistic and some more complex in nature.
        I would like to list them all in a list format due to the brevity of time. These are links that will take you to 
        either my Github, or the website where the project is located.

        <ul>
            <li>InvisibleRage!: This video game was my first dive into Game Development. It can be played at 
                <a href="https://visibleninja.itch.io/invisiblerage">Itch.io</a>.
            </li>
            <li>Besides this, many other of my projects can be reached at <a href="https://github.com/ali92115">
            My Github</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
